## Features

![Showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/probablykory/more-crossbows/main/showcase.jpg)

Crossbows crafted from:  Wood, Bronze, Iron, Silver & Blackmetal.  
New bolts:  Wood, Fire, Poison, Silver & Frost.  
New recipes for earlier crafting of existing bolts: Bone, Iron & Blackmetal.  

Also I've added an endgame bolt & arrow, disabled by default.  Because shooting lightning is fun but overpowered.
